# wasm-bindgen-hello
A simple project template made after the [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) tutorial.

Requires the nightly Rust toolset, wasm-bindgen and npm.

`build.sh` and `clean.sh` scripts build and clean the project.
`run_server.sh` runs a webpack-dev-server at <http://localhost:8080/>.
